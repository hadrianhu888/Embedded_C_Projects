# Embedded_C_Projects

These are some the Embedded C and C++ projects I worked on in the last two days as of writing.

# Thermostat project

A simple thermostat with various controls for the house, by room, by door, and has sensors and actuators. 

# PID Project	

Involves a simple PID with feedback loop and the controller iteratively updates the PID controls. 

# Automotive Energy		

A more complex project with hardware input-output, data types, different battery types and battery PID control, and Kalman Filter.
